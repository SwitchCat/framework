This folder is intended to hold all custom user built controller classes.

The framework already handles:
    * Http requests                     => SwitchCat\Control\HttpControl
    * Ajax requests                     => SwitchCat\Control\AjaxControl
    * Command line interface requests   => SwitchCat\Control\CliControl

These classes extend the main controller SwitchCat\Control\Control

Your custom class should extend one of these classes
